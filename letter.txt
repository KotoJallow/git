Hi bro
I wanted to ask something.

Firstly, It is amazing working with Assutech. I really enjoyed working with ASSUTECH. The team is amazing and I have greatly benefited from them. I have some concerns about my future. I want to get things clear and right from now on and know my stance. I visited a grandpa, he has been in states for 38+ years, a system engineer and a cybersecurity expert. He advised me to be clear on these issues.
What's my stance right now?

On what basis am I working and what are the feature prospects?
What's the agreement; you made mention you want inshallah all benefits be shared by the team members but to what extent exactly? How can we implement the benefits? What are the benefits of working? The mobile wallet specifically what's my stake, just want to know now, and Assutech generally. What are your thoughts and plans? Will I be working as an employee
Or what other benefits could possibly arise?



I told him I cannot ask such questions he said you have to do it now and know your stance to avoid false hopes and expectations. 

PS: Don't take it personally, your response will in no way jeopardize our relationship and am happy working with you it will just help me in future decision making.
