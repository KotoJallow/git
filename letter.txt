20th September 2019.
Dear Brother, 

It was amazing working with Assutech. I really enjoyed working with ASSUTECH. The team was amazing and I have greatly benefited and learned from them. 

Notwithstanding, I have a few concerns about my future. I want to get things clear and right from now on and know my stance. Recently, I visited a grand-father, he has been in the United States for 38+ years, a system engineer and a cybersecurity expert. He advised me to be clear on these issues enumerated below.

What's my stance right now with Assutech?
On what basis am I working and what are the future prospects?
What's the agreement; you made mention “you want inshallah all benefits be shared by the team members” but to what extent exactly? 
How can we implement the benefits? 
What are the benefits of working? 
The mobile wallet specifically what's my stake, just want to know now, and Assutech generally?
What are your thoughts and plans, will I be working as an employee Or what other benefits could possibly arise?


I told him I cannot ask such questions he said I have to do it now and know your stance to avoid false hopes and expectations. 

PS: Don't take it personally, your response will in no way jeopardize our relationship and am happy working with you it will just help me in future decision making.

Yours Sincerely
Abdourahman Jallow
